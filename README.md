# Blog

Quarto website for the pivotools blog.

## Rendering

Posts are **notebooks** (e.g. `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/index.ipynb`). You must pass **`--execute`** when rendering so that notebook cells are run; otherwise Quarto does not execute them by default.

The project also uses **freeze** for posts (`posts/_metadata.yml`): during a **global** project render (`quarto render .`), code in posts is not re-executed—cached output in `_freeze/` is reused. **`--execute` does not override freeze**: a full `quarto render . --execute` still uses the frozen cache for posts, so the HTML will not reflect changes to code or data unless you do one of the following.

### Single command from project root that always runs the post

From the **blog** directory, render the post by path (incremental render). This always executes code and ignores freeze:

```bash
quarto render posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/index.ipynb --execute
```

Use this when you’ve changed the notebook, `src/`, or `data/` and want updated HTML for that post.

### Full site render (all pages, may use frozen cache)

To build the whole site (e.g. before publishing):

```bash
quarto render . --execute
```

With freeze enabled, posts still use `_freeze/` and do not re-run. There is **no** `--no-freeze` CLI option in Quarto.

### Full site render with fresh execution (override freeze)

To force all posts to re-execute from the project root in one go, clear the freeze cache and then render:

```bash
rm -rf _freeze && quarto render . --execute
```

This is the single command that bypasses the frozen cache for a full site build.

## Preventing committed notebook output

To avoid committing cell outputs and execution metadata in `.ipynb` files, use a **pre-commit hook** that strips output from staged notebooks before each commit. The hook lives in the **repository root** (the repo that contains `blog/`), not inside `blog/`:

- **Path:** `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (at the repo root)
- **Make it executable:** `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

The script below uses `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output` on every staged `.ipynb` file. If, after clearing output, there are no remaining changes to commit, the hook exits with failure so the commit is aborted.

```sh

#!/bin/sh
for f in $(git diff --name-only --cached); do
    case "$f" in
        *.ipynb)
            jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace "$f"
            git add "$f"
            ;;
    esac
done

if git diff --name-only --cached --exit-code
then
    echo "No changes detected after removing notebook output"
    exit 1
fi
```

Requires `jupyter`/`nbconvert` to be available (`pip install nbconvert`).

## Project layout

- **`src/`** – Python helpers used by posts (`plotting.py`, `data.py`).
- **`data/`** – Data files (e.g. puzzle JSON, solution scripts) under `blog/data/`.
- **`posts/*/index.{qmd,ipynb,md}`** – Only these index files are rendered as posts (see `_quarto.yml`).
- **`_output/`** – Rendered site (e.g. for GitHub Pages).
- **`_freeze/`** – Cached execution results for frozen posts; safe to delete to force re-execution.

Execution directory is the blog root (`execute-dir: project`), so paths like `data/` and `src/` resolve from the blog directory.

## Python dependencies

The blog uses Python for `src/` helpers (plotting, data loading, references conversion) and for executing notebook cells. Install dependencies into a virtual environment so Quarto uses them when rendering.

**Create and use a venv (from the blog directory):**

```bash
cd blog
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then render as usual (e.g. `quarto render posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/index.ipynb --execute`). If Quarto was started from a terminal that has the venv activated, it will use that Python and the installed packages.

**Optional:** For the pre-commit hook that clears notebook output, install `nbconvert` in the same venv: `pip install nbconvert`.

**What’s in `requirements.txt`:** `jupyter` (running notebook cells when Quarto executes), `numpy` (for plotly express), `plotly` (figures), `IPython` (HTML display in notebooks), `pygments` (syntax highlighting of solution code), `PyYAML` (reading `style/style.yml`).

## References (citations)

Some posts use Quarto’s built-in bibliography (BibTeX + CSL) so in-text citations and the reference list are numbered and hyperlinked.

For the **agentic_coding_arc_agi** post:

- **Source of truth:** `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/80_references.md` — one line per reference in the form `[N] [Title](url)`.
- **Generated file:** `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/references.bib` — used by Quarto at render time. Do not edit by hand; regenerate it from the markdown file.
- **Conversion script:** From the **blog** directory, run:
  ```bash
  python src/md_to_bib.py
  ```
  This reads `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/80_references.md` and writes `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/references.bib`. Optional args: `python src/md_to_bib.py [input.md] [output.bib]`.

**When to regenerate:** After adding, removing, or changing entries in `80_references.md`, run `python src/md_to_bib.py` and commit the updated `references.bib`.

**In-text citations:** In the post’s `text/*.md` files, references use Pandoc syntax: `[@ref1]` for a single citation and `[@ref6; @ref7]` for multiple. The notebook YAML points to `text/references.bib` and `../../style/ieee.csl` and enables `link-citations` and `link-bibliography`.

## Styling options

Styling is split into (1) Quarto project and document YAML and (2) programmatic figure styling in YAML.

**1. Quarto project and document (header YAML)**  
- **Project:** `_quarto.yml` — site title, navbar, output dir, which files are rendered, and default HTML format (e.g. `format.html.theme`, `format.html.css`).  
- **Document:** Each post’s `index.ipynb` or `index.qmd` has a YAML header — title, subtitle, format overrides, bibliography, and options like `fig-align` or `code-fold`.  
- **Theme CSS:** `styles.css` is included via `_quarto.yml` (`format.html.css`) and affects layout, fonts, and figure/caption styling site-wide.

**2. Programmatic figures (style YAML)**  
- **File:** `style/style.yml` — loaded by `src/plotting.py` and used for all figures generated in code (e.g. baseline-vs-interleaved scatter and bar charts, puzzle heatmaps).  
- **Contents:**  
  - `code_highlight` — Pygments style for solution code in puzzle figures.  
  - `colors` — ARC puzzle heatmap palette and palette name.  
  - `figures.baseline_vs_interleaved` — shared colors and shapes for figures that use `data/baseline_vs_interleaved.json` (scatter and bar).  
  - `figures.scatter_baseline_vs_interleaved` — axis ranges, marker size, arrow and layout for the cost–score scatter.  
  - `figures.bar_baseline_vs_interleaved` — axis, series names, and layout for the bar figure.  
- Changing colors (e.g. `figures.baseline_vs_interleaved.colors.baseline`) or shapes in `style/style.yml` updates the programmatic figures without editing Python.

## Building from scratch (files required)

To generate the site or a post from a fresh clone, the following files are required. Paths are relative to the **blog** directory.

### Project-level (blog root)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_quarto.yml` | Project config, render list, format |
| `styles.css` | HTML theme CSS |
| `src/plotting.py` | Used by notebook cells (e.g. `show_puzzle`) |
| `src/md_to_bib.py` | Script to generate `references.bib` from `80_references.md` (see References) |
| `data/puzzles/9aaea919.json`, `45a5af55.json`, `45a5af55.py` | Puzzle data for figures in agentic_coding_arc_agi post |
| `data/interleaved_thinking_gpt_oss_num_tool_calls.json` | Data for tool-calls histogram in agentic_coding_arc_agi post |
| `style/ieee.csl` | Citation style (numbered refs); notebook uses `../../style/ieee.csl` |

Optional: `style/style.yml` (see [Styling options](#styling-options)).

### Post-specific: agentic_coding_arc_agi

Run from blog root: `quarto render posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/index.ipynb --execute`.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/index.ipynb` | Notebook (YAML, includes, code cells) |
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/00_overview.md` … `08_acknowledgements.md` | Included content |
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/80_references.md` | Source of truth for references |
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/references.bib` | Generated from 80_references.md (run `python src/md_to_bib.py`) |
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/90_appendix.md` | Appendix content |
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/figs/interleaved_thinking_schematic.svg` | Figure (from 03_interleaved_thinking.md) |
| `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/figs/interleaved_thinking_examples.svg` | Figure (from 03_interleaved_thinking.md) |

### Git: add these for a full from-scratch build

Ensure these are tracked so a fresh clone can build without extra steps:

- `src/md_to_bib.py` — so `references.bib` can be regenerated from `80_references.md`.
- `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/08_acknowledgements.md` — acknowledgements section.
- `style/ieee.csl` — required for citation rendering.
- Optionally `posts/agentic_coding_arc_agi/text/references.bib` — so the post builds without running the conversion script.
